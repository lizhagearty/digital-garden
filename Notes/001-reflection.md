Sometimes I wonder if I'm on the right path. Everyone seems to have it all figured out, but here I am, 25 and still unsure about my career, my relationships, even my own identity. Is this what they call a quarter-life crisis?

I've been thinking a lot about what truly matters to me. Is it success in the traditional sense - a high-paying job, a nice apartment, the perfect Instagram feed? Or is it something more intangible - personal growth, meaningful connections, making a difference in the world?

Maybe the point isn't to have it all figured out. Maybe the journey of self-discovery is the whole point. Note to self: embrace the uncertainty. It's okay not to have all the answers right now.
