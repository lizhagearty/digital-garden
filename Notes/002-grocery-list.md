Just finished a 48-hour digital detox and wow, what an eye-opener. I didn't realize how addicted I was to my phone until I put it away. The first few hours were tough - I kept reaching for it out of habit. But then something shifted.

I found myself noticing things I usually miss - the way the light filters through the leaves, the sound of birds in the morning, the smell of coffee brewing. I had actual, uninterrupted conversations with my roommate. I read a book - a physical, paper book! - for hours without checking Instagram every few minutes.

It made me realize how much of life we miss when we're constantly plugged in. Don't get me wrong, I love technology and social media has its place. But I think I need to find a better balance.

Ideas for maintaining digital wellness:
- No phones at the dinner table
- Social media-free Sundays
- Read a book before bed instead of scrolling
- Practice mindfulness for 10 minutes each day

Remember this feeling, Emma. Life happens in the moments between notifications.
